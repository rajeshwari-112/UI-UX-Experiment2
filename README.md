## **Aim:**

To design a mobile e-learning app prototype using UI/UX principles like Gestalt, Affordance, and Consistency to create a clean, intuitive, and engaging interface.


## **Algorithm / Procedure:**

1. Identify user needs and core app functions (learning, progress tracking, exploring courses).
2. Apply **Gestalt laws** for visual grouping and hierarchy.
3. Create layouts for Login, Home, Course Details, and Profile screens.
4. Define color palette, typography, and component consistency.
5. Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
6. Prototype in Figma and test for navigation and usability clarity.



## **Output:**

* **Screens:** Login, Home, Course Details, Profile.
* **Components:** Buttons, Cards, Navigation Bar, Modals.
* **Flow:** Home → Course → Lesson → Progress → Profile.
